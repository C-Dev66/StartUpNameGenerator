# StartUpNameGenerator
> This multi-platform application(Andoird, iOS, Web) creates a simple app that generates proposed names for a startup company. The user can select and unselect names, saving the best ones. The code lazily generates 10 names at a time. As the user scrolls, more names are generated. There is no limit to how far a user can scroll.

## Code Snippets

> Setting up the application
```
// Creating the project

flutter create startup_namer
cd startup_namer

// Set up dependencies

flutter pub add english_words
```

> Configure the start of the application 
```dart
import 'package:english_words/english_words.dart';
import 'package:flutter/material.dart';

class MyApp extends StatelessWidget {
  const MyApp({Key? key}) : super(key: key);

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return MaterialApp(
      title: 'Startup Name Generator'
...
class RandomWords extends StatefulWidget {
  const RandomWords({Key? key}) : super(key: key);

  @override
  State<RandomWords> createState() => _RandomWordsState();
}
...
class _RandomWordsState extends State<RandomWords> {
  final _suggestions = <WordPair>[];
  final _biggerFont = const TextStyle(fontSize: 18.0);
  final _saved = <WordPair>{}; //NEW

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    return Scaffold(
        appBar: AppBar(
          title: const Text('Startup Name Generator')
...
```

> Create an infinate scrolling ListView
```dart
        body: ListView.builder(
            padding: const EdgeInsets.all(16.0),
            itemBuilder: /*1*/ (context, i) {
              if (i.isOdd) return const Divider(); /*2*/

              final index = i ~/ 2; /*3*/
              if (index >= _suggestions.length) {
                _suggestions.addAll(generateWordPairs().take(10)); /*4*/
              }
...

```

> Adding security & validation rules cloud.firestore
```
rules_version = '2';
service cloud.firestore {
  match /databases/{database}/documents {
    match /guestbook/{entry} {
      allow read: if request.auth.uid != null;
      allow write:
      if request.auth.uid == request.resource.data.userId
          && "name" in request.resource.data
          && "text" in request.resource.data
          && "timestamp" in request.resource.data;
    }
  }
}
```
